These reliable and effective systems are built with the help of domain experts and knowledge engineers. Domain experts are the experts in a particular domain who have in-depth knowledge in that field. Knowledge engineers are the technical experts who translate the expertise of domain experts to develop the expert system.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Few years ago, the organizations were not confident about the implementation of Artificial Intelligence to a system due to the lack of knowledge, resources, and a gap between the research and usage of Artificial Intelligence. During that period, the industry was confident about the implementation of Expert Systems and that&rsquo;s when there were use cases in Healthcare, Virus Detection, Loan Analysis, Stock market trading, Employee performance analysis, etc.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">In recent years, with the advancement and awareness of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data, the industries have accepted and have developed confidence in the implementation of these technologies to gain benefits and prepare organizations for a new stream of income. The Artificial Intelligence systems learn and emulate the decision-making ability of humans whereas the expert systems solve problems with the help of a knowledge base which mainly comprises if-then rules developed by domain experts.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">We believe that expert systems do exist today. With the advancement of AI and ML, these systems have improved and are capable of solving more complex problems. Some call them Artificial Intelligence systems and some, rule-based/knowledge-based systems or expert systems.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.rm42qgveai06"><span class="c8">References:</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><ol class="c5 lst-kix_9vvgm9xxvp6-0 start" start="1"><li class="c6"><span class="c10"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.leanix.net/en/blog/artificial-intelligence-expert-systems&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587416605879000">https://www.leanix.net/en/blog/artificial-intelligence-expert-systems</a></span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c10"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.guru99.com/expert-systems-with-applications.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587416605879000">https://www.guru99.com/expert-systems-with-applications.html</a></span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c10"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expert-systems/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587416605879000">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expert-systems/</a></span></li></ol></body>
